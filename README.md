# Calcclt

A simple calculator that can add, subtract, multiply and divide numbers.

I have added a simple number guessing game just for fun.
Because why not?

Ok, I think I wont be developing further since I just discovered
there's a WAY better calc project built in c

Check it out [https://github.com/lcn2/calc], I may contribute to that project instead.
When I get better at C.
